As a summer 2021 <a href = "https://datascience.si.edu/people/dalila-lara">undergraduate intern</a> I worked on studying the genomics and evolution of the genus <i>Syntrichia</i>. Programmed Unix Shells to align, sort, and organize genetic DNA sequence and build gene trees of the genus <i>Syntrichia</i>. Applied R-Code, and learned Python to explore large data sets for each samples. Used R & Python to manipulate and analyze 600+ data sets with large data samples.
