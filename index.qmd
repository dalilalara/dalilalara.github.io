<h2>Hello I'm Dalila \[Da-lee-la\]!</h2>

I am a recent Master of Environmental Data Science graduate from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). Throughout my academic journey and practical experiences both in the field and beyond, I've come to recognize the paramount significance of data collection and analysis in environmental science. I am driven to continually enhance my data science expertise to equip myself as a proficient environmental researcher. My goal is to channel my acquired data science skills towards promoting environmental sustainability and conservation, while also fostering the inclusion of underrepresented minorities in the realm of environmental science.
